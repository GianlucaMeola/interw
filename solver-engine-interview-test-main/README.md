# solver-engine-interview-test
Instructions:
The repository contains class called SolverEngine.Its job is to take input from the user, retrieve cost  based on that data from 2 external systems and return the best one.
Apply SOLID and DDD to refactor the class to make it more readable, testable, configurable and extensible.
Fix any bugs or code smells that you see
Add tests

 
Notes:
ExpandoObjects and dynamic were used for class declarations, where implementation details aren’t relevant for this task (requests and responses for engine systems in real time).
Some code was snipped to keep the task small, instead there’s a comment of what happens there.
The solution is open ended, but we expect most people to spend no more than 1-2 hours on it. It doesn’t need to be perfect or complete, just demonstrating the main concepts is enough. 
We will go through the test during the interview, so you will have a chance to talk through anything else that could be done with more time.
